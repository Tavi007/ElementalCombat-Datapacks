# Balancing Concept

The normal path through the twilight forest usually starts with the Naga boss followed by the Lich. After that the progression opens up and the player can choose to either go to the swamp, the dark forest or the ice forest. The last biome to tackle are the mountains. I tried to balance the datapack around this progression, by giving the bosses certain weaknesses. For example the Snow Queen will take additional damage by the style bash. If you went through the Twilight Knight Stronghold beforehand and aquired the block and chain, then you have a powerful weapon against the queen. Similar the Ice Bow is effective against the Hydra.

Keep in mind that the numbers might need adjustments, because balancing is an iterative process and takes a bit of time.
