# ElementalCombat-Datapacks

A collection of all the datapacks for different mods. Every pack is balanced around the default setting of the mod, tho this will mostly likely be an ongoing process.

Feel free to use and change them for your modpack.

You can also suggest some balance changes with a pull request. Please describe your reasoning for the balance changes (keep in mind, that these changes must base on the default values!).
My method is the following: Entities can have a defense value up to 100, while biomes can have up to 50. Entities should only rarely have more than 100 defense (elemental defense higher than 100 will result in healing).
